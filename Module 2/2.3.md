# Configuring Lambda Destinations to Handle Successful Invocations

## Introduction
To enhance the automation of the Cloudtopia Passport Office Automation Project, this documentation guides you through configuring Lambda Destinations to automatically handle successful Lambda function executions. By using Lambda Destinations, we can direct the outcome of the Lambda function’s invocation to the designated **ValidationResult** SNS topic without writing additional code for message handling within the function itself. This ensures a streamlined, error-resilient process for notifying stakeholders of photo validation results.

## **Step 1: Update Lambda Function to Return a Valid HTTP Response**

1. **Modify the Lambda Function Code:**
   - Access your **PhotoValidationProcessor** function in the AWS Lambda console.
   - Navigate to the **Code** source tab.
   - Ensure your function logic concludes with a JSON object that encapsulates the necessary information about the validation process. This JSON should include the file name, validation result, reasons for failure if any, and the file location. Here’s an example of what the code snippet might look like:

     ```python
     # Step 6 - Pipe result using Lambda Destinations
     publish_object = {
         'FileName': current_file_name,
         'ValidationResult': face_evaluation_result['result'],
         'FailureReasons': json.dumps(face_evaluation_result['failure_reasons']),
         'FileLocation': BUCKET_NAME + "/" + current_file_name,
     }
     return {
         'statusCode': 200,
         'body': json.dumps(publish_object)
     }
     ```

   - Click **Deploy** to save your changes.

## **Step 2: Configure Lambda Destinations for the Function**

1. **Set Up the Destination:**
   - In the Lambda console, view the configuration overview of your **PhotoValidationProcessor** function.
   - Scroll to the **Asynchronous invocation** settings and click **Edit**.
   - Under **Destination**, select **On success**.
   - Choose **SNS topic** as the destination type and select the **ValidationResult** topic from the dropdown list.
   - Ensure the destination configuration reflects your intent for the function to interact with SNS upon successful executions.

## **Step 3: Test the Entire Workflow**

1. **Upload a Test Image to Trigger the Function:**
   - Navigate to the S3 bucket linked with your Lambda function.
   - Upload an image that meets the criteria to trigger the function (e.g., `me_eyes_closed.png`).
   - This upload should invoke the Lambda function asynchronously.

2. **Verify the Outcome in SNS:**
   - After the function executes, check the email associated with your SNS topic subscription.
   - You should receive an email notification containing the output from the Lambda function, formatted as specified in the `publish_object`. Ensure it includes details such as the file name, validation result, failure reasons (if any), and file location.

   Example snippet from the email payload:
   ```json
   "responsePayload": {
       "statusCode": 200,
       "body": "{\"FileName\":\"me_eyes_closed.png\",\"ValidationResult\":\"FAIL\",\"FailureReasons\":\"[\\\"EyesOpen\\\"]\",\"FileLocation\":\"cloudtopia-images-jun-2024/me_eyes_closed.png\"}"
   }
   ```

## Conclusion
With Lambda Destinations configured to handle successful invocations, your **PhotoValidationProcessor** function now effectively communicates its outcomes directly to the SNS topic, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing the complexity of the system. This setup not only ensures that stakeholders are promptly informed about the photo validation results but also leverages AWS services to maintain a robust, scalable notification mechanism.
