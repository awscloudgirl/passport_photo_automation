# Integrating with Lambda Destinations: Enhancing Message Handling

To further automate and streamline the photo validation workflow, we will integrate Lambda Destinations with our existing Passport Office setup. Instead of manually writing code to publish messages to SNS and handling error cases, Lambda Destinations automatically delivers messages to a destination of your choice on success or failure. Because the S3 to Lambda invocation is asynchronous, this feature is a perfect fit. Other integrations, such as SQS to Lambda, do not support this functionality because they are not asynchronous. By configuring Lambda Destinations, you can direct the outcome of each invocation to separate success or failure destinations, ensuring a reliable and flexible messaging system for photo validation results.

## Creating the ValidationResult SNS Topic

### Introduction
To facilitate automated notifications whenever photo validation completes, we will establish an SNS topic named **ValidationResult**. This topic will act as the messaging endpoint for our Lambda function, enabling it to publish notifications upon processing completion. This guide will walk you through creating the SNS topic, configuring a subscription for it, and testing its functionality by sending a test message.

## **Step 1: Navigate to SNS and Create a Topic**
1. **Access the SNS Console:**
   - Log in to your AWS Management Console and open the Amazon SNS service.
   
2. **Create a New Topic:**
   - Go to the **Topics** section and click **Create topic**.
   - Set the type to **Standard**.
   - Enter **ValidationResult** as the topic name.
   - Click **Create topic** to finalize the setup.

## **Step 2: Set Up a Subscription to Test the Topic**
1. **Initiate Subscription Creation:**
   - Click on the **ValidationResult** topic you just created.
   - Select **Create subscription**.
   
2. **Configure the Subscription:**
   - For **Protocol**, choose **Email-JSON**.
   - Enter your email address in the **Endpoint** field where notifications should be sent.
   - Click **Create subscription**.

3. **Confirm the Subscription:**
   - Navigate to **Subscriptions** under the SNS console.
   - You should see your new subscription listed with a **Pending confirmation** status.
   - Check your email for a message from AWS SNS containing a confirmation link. Click this link to activate the subscription.
   - Refresh the **Subscriptions** page in the SNS console to see the status change to **Confirmed**.

## **Step 3: Test the Functionality of the SNS Topic**
1. **Publish a Test Message:**
   - Return to your **ValidationResult** topic in the SNS console.
   - Click **Publish message**.
   - Enter a **Subject** such as "Test" and type some sample JSON data into the **Message body**.
   - Click **Publish message** to send.

2. **Verify Email Receipt:**
   - Check the email address you subscribed with to confirm that you received the test message.
   - Ensure the message content matches what you published.

### Conclusion
You have successfully created the **ValidationResult** SNS topic and confirmed its functionality through subscription and test messaging. This topic is now ready to be integrated with your Lambda function for automated publishing of validation results, streamlining notifications for photo processing outcomes in your project.
