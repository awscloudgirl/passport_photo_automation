# Attaching SNS:Publish Permission to the Lambda Function

## Introduction
For the **PhotoValidationProcessor** Lambda function to publish messages to the **ValidationResult** SNS topic, it must be granted appropriate permissions. This step involves modifying the IAM execution role associated with your Lambda function to include permissions for publishing to SNS. This guide details how to attach an IAM policy that enables the Lambda function to interact with the SNS topic effectively.

## **Step 1: Access the Lambda Function's Execution Role**
1. **Open the Lambda Console:**
   - Log in to your AWS Management Console and navigate to the Lambda service.
   - Select the **PhotoValidationProcessor** function from your list of Lambda functions.

2. **Modify the Execution Role:**
   - Click on the **Configuration** tab.
   - Under the **Permissions** tab, find the **Execution role** section and click on the role name to open the IAM Management Console for that role.

## **Step 2: Create and Attach an Inline Policy for SNS Publish**
1. **Initiate Inline Policy Creation:**
   - Within the IAM role page, click **Add permissions**, then select **Create inline policy**.

2. **Define the Policy to Publish to SNS:**
   - In the **Create Policy** interface, select the **JSON** tab to manually enter the policy, or use the visual editor.
   - Choose **SNS** as the service.
   - Under actions, select **Publish**.
   - Specify the resource by entering the ARN of the **ValidationResult** SNS topic.

3. **Specify the Resource:**
   - Click on **Resources**, select **Specific**, and then click **Add ARN**.
   - Enter the region, account number, and topic name (ValidationResult). This restricts the policy to only allow publishing to this specific SNS topic.
   - Click **Add**.

4. **Review and Create the Policy:**
   - After setting the actions and resources, click **Review policy**.
   - Give your policy a name (e.g., "LambdaSNSPublishPermission") and a description.
   - Click **Create policy** to attach it to the Lambda execution role.

## **Step 3: Verify Policy Attachment**
1. **Check the Execution Role Again:**
   - Return to the IAM role associated with your Lambda function.
   - Ensure the new policy appears in the list of policies attached to the role.

2. **Validate Permissions:**
   - You can optionally test the function's ability to publish to the SNS topic by triggering it or using the AWS Policy Simulator.

#### Conclusion
Your **PhotoValidationProcessor** Lambda function now has the necessary permissions to publish messages to the **ValidationResult** SNS topic. This setup ensures that when the function processes an image and determines its validation status, it can automatically notify subscribers via SNS, enhancing the automation and responsiveness of your system.
