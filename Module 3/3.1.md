# Integrating API Gateway with Lambda for Image Retrieval

To enhance the automation of the Cloudtopia Passport Office Automation Project, we will configure Lambda Destinations to automatically handle successful Lambda function executions. By integrating Lambda Destinations, we can direct the outcomes of Lambda invocations to the designated ValidationResult SNS topic. This method removes the need for additional coding within the Lambda function for message handling, ensuring a streamlined and error-resilient notification process for stakeholders regarding photo validation results.
